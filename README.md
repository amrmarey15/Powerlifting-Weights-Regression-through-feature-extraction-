# Powerlifting-Weights-Regression-through-feature-extraction-
This program aims to predict the 1-rep/3-rep of powerlifters for the three main lifts: Bench/Squat/Deadlift. The goal of this program is to help advanced lifters with their training by implementing the predicted results into their training workout routine and to give them more confidence going into future powerlifting competitions

Dataset taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/open-powerlifting/powerlifting-database/version/2

This Readme will provide a clear explanation of how the program works

Firstly, separate machine learning models will be developed based on sexes. As such, this dataset will be divided into two seperate datasets. One dataset will contain only the male powerlifting partcipants and the other will contain the female powerlifting partcipants. The purpose of this is to investigate if there exists varying results.
